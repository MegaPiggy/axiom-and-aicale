# Axiom's Refuge

Adds a planet and moon named Axiom and Aicale.
After learning of impending doom, the alpha hearthians modify an escape pod and shoot it towards another solar system.


This is my entry for the 3rd Outer Wilds Jam and also is my first "story" mod so don't expect much. At most it has one task, many NPCs, and a few locations you can explore.

This mod changes some sound to their Alpha equivalents. If you dislike them you can change it in the mod settings.
