      <Page>This ancient statue is the subject of a heated debate.</Page>
      <Page>The level-headed among us adhere to the obvious explanation that the statue simply phase-shifts whenever you look away from it.</Page>
      <Page>That hasn't stopped our more imaginative thinkers from making the (ridiculous) argument that it actually exists in every possible configuration simultaneously and only collapses to a single state while it is being observed.</Page>
      <Page>Whatever the explanation, both sides agree that the effect is extremely creepy.</Page>
